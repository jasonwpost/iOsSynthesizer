#Simple synthesizer app

This is a fun little synthesizer app I'm making just to play around with Swift,
Xcode, and AudioKit. There are probably much better synthesizer apps out there
but hey, its fun.

**I aim to add modules in this order:**

- ADSR (done)
- Noise (pink and white) (GUI elements added, still need to do add the code )
- Waveform selector (sine, saw, triangle, etc)
- Reverb and delay
- Keyboard

**Some cool things that I've haven't seen in action yet**

- Using 3D touch for a whammy bar
- Some kind of generative/sequencer type thing, maybe in another tab view?s
